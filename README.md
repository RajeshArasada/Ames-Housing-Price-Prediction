# Ames-Housing-Price-Prediction
This Kaggle competition challenges the users to predict the price of a house given over 75 odd predictors. The repository contains my code and all collateral related to this project.
The entire code is divided in three different Jupyter notebook:
Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis
Machine Learning with Linear Models
Machine Learning with Tree-based Models
I also wrote a blogpost  https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/predicting-iowa-housing-prices-2/
